The functions for this model are broken up into four primary folders with some 
sub folders within the simulation folder. I find it easiest to download & 
unzip the folders into a convenient location for yourself (possibly the Matlab 
folder), then within Matlab add with subfolders the "simulation", "analysis", 
"helper", and "data_modification" folders to the Matlab path. In Matlab, the 
only scripts you need are main_babies.m (for simulation, clustering, and 
genealogical data creation) and main_analysis.m (for figure creation, data 
writing to .csv, and measures of the data). The usefulness of 
main_modify_data.m is for renaming large data sets, but is of a secondary or 
tertiary level of importance.
